    <h1 className='about-me'>Greetings! My name is Thomas Limmer.  I was born and raised in Central Texas, specifically Rosebud, Texas
    and moved to Houston in the spring of 2013. I attended CH Yoe High School in Cameron, Texas. I was involved in
    a wide array of clubs and athletics including student council, football, baseball and theater. 
    In 2008, I graduated from high school and accepted a football scholarship to Harding University in Searcy, Arkansas. I transferred to The University of Mary-Hardin Baylor to finish while academic studies while also competing on the University's 
    football team. After graduating in the spring of 2013, I then moved to Houston, Texas and started a career as a personal trainer
    at 24 Hour Fitness. After 8+ years as a personal trainer and a promotion to Assistant Fitness Manager, Covid-19 struct the country
    and derailed my plans in the fitness industry. After careful consideration I realized that I needed to pursue my passion of computers
    and enrolled in the University of Texas Full-Stack Web Development coding program. I will graduate in September 2021 and will continue
    to further my knowledge in the field. </h1>
